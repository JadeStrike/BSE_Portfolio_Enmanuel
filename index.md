# Robot Arm

Hello, I am Enmanuel. My project is a mechanical arm that can be controlled through a variety of ways, including processing. The arm will be able to grab, hold, and transfer small, light items. This will be accomplished through the usage of five servo motors that will be connected to the robot arm.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is using processing to control the arm. Processing is a new computer language/extension of the Java language which aims to introduce programming languages to electronic art and electronic art to programmers. The first step to my final milestone was to download processing, which was very simple. The next step was to upload the code to the arm that would allow it to receive and inputs from processing. Finally, I had to run the code in the processing app that would allow it to send inputs in the first place. Once all of this was complete, I was able to control the arm through the processing interface. I can also control it using my keyboard.

# Second Milestone
My second milestone is controlling the robot arm with five potentiometers and through a GUI powered by python. To accomplish control with the potentiometers, I uploaded the code to the arduino board which would allow it to receive and translate the inputs of the potentiometers to motion of the arm. After that, I was able to control the arm with the potentiometers. In contrast, the GUI took a little more effort; the first step was to download python, which would allow the servosGUI.py file to work. After that, I uploaded the code to the arduino board that would allow it to communicate with my computer in such a way that would allow it to be controlled with the GUI. Finally, I opened the servosGUI.py file and connected it to COM6 (the port that the arm was connected to). After all of this, control of the arm was successful.

# First Milestone
My first milestone is controlling the servo motor with my phone via bluetooth. The first step was to write a code that would allow the arduino to receive data packets from the bluetooth module and then transmit those data packets to the servo motor. After that, I connected the servo motor to the GND, -9, and 3.3V pins of the arduino uno board. Then I had to download the .apk app that would control the servo motor. After doing all of this, I was able to control the motor with my phone.
