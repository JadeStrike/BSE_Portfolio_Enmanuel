# Phone-Controlled Robot Arm
My project is a mechanical arm that can be controlled via bluetooth and an apk app that will allow an android device to control the arm. The arm will be able to grab, hold, and transfer small, light items. This will be accomplished through the usage of five servo motors that will be connected to the robot arm.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# Second Milestone
My second milestone is controlling the robot arm with five potentiometers and through a GUI powered by python. The first step in this was

# First Milestone
My first milestone is controlling the servo motor with my phone via bluetooth. The first step was to write a code that would allow the arduino to receive data packets from the bluetooth module and then transmit those data packets to the servo motor. After that, I connected the servo motor to the GND, -9, and 3.3V pins of the arduino uno board. Then I had to download the .apk app that would control the servo motor. After doing all of this, I was able to control the motor with my phone.
