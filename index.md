# Phone-Controlled Robot Arm
Hello, I am Enmanuel. My project is a mechanical arm that can be controlled via bluetooth and an apk app that will allow an android device to control the arm. The arm will be able to grab, hold, and transfer small, light items. This will be accomplished through the usage of five servo motors that will be connected to the robot arm.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# Second Milestone
My second milestone is controlling the robot arm with five potentiometers and through a GUI powered by python. To accomplish control with the potentiometers, I uploaded the code to the arduino board which would allow it to receive and translate the inputs of the potentiometers to motion of the arm. After that, I was able to control the arm with the potentiometers. In contrast, the GUI took a little more effort; the first step was to download python, which would allow the servosGUI.py file to work. After that, I uploaded the code to the arduino board that would allow it to communicate with my computer in such a way that would allow it to be controlled with the GUI. Finally, I opened the servosGUI.py file and connected it to COM6 (the port that the arm was connected to). After all of this, control of the arm was successful.

# First Milestone
My first milestone is controlling the servo motor with my phone via bluetooth. The first step was to write a code that would allow the arduino to receive data packets from the bluetooth module and then transmit those data packets to the servo motor. After that, I connected the servo motor to the GND, -9, and 3.3V pins of the arduino uno board. Then I had to download the .apk app that would control the servo motor. After doing all of this, I was able to control the motor with my phone.
